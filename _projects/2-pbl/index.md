**Collaboration:** Worked with a Train Equipment Maker Company to improve equipment maintenance and knowledge transfer processes.

**Proposals:**  
- **Predictive Monitoring System:**  
  - Remote monitoring of train equipment to enable early fault detection.  
  - Plan repairs in advance, reduce unexpected downtime, and ensure high safety and reliability.  
  - Retrofit existing equipment with attachable monitoring units.  

- **Cloud Knowledge Platform:**  
  - Store repair cases, procedures, repair time, and responsible engineer info.  
  - Enable junior engineers to independently perform maintenance.  
  - Reduce reliance on senior engineers, improve technical skills, and standardize repair quality.  

**Future Potential:**  
- Enhance product reliability and consistency.  
- Facilitate knowledge transfer and workforce training.  
- Potential commercialization of the cloud system as an industrial knowledge solution.
