Integrated a dual-arm manipulator equipped with a LiDAR camera for precision fastening operations.  
Used deep-learning–based **instance segmentation** with **Detectron2** for object recognition and developed **path-planning algorithms** for coordinated dual-arm motion under ROS2.

**Highlights:**
- Real-time LiDAR-based perception for high-precision alignment.  
- Dual-arm coordination with adaptive path planning.  
- Modular pipeline built on PyTorch and ROS2 for fast iteration.
