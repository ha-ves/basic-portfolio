Developed a **secure STM32-based UAV Ground Control Station**, later published in **IEEE International Electronics Symposium (IES) 2022**.

**Highlights:**
- AES-128–encrypted communication between UAV and base station.  
- Fuzzy Inference System for **real-time flight stability assessment** and **remaining-time prediction**.  
- Cross-platform **Xamarin UI** for low-latency telemetry visualization.
